# Decentralized Anonymous Scheme Using Threshold BBS+

## Objective
Develop a pioneering decentralized scheme utilizing Threshold BBS+ signatures to ensure complete user anonymity and prevent activity tracking. This project is implemented using Solidity and Python within a simulated Ethereum environment.

## Key Features

- **Threshold BBS+ Signatures**: 
  - Create an anonymous credential scheme that guarantees unlinkability and unforgeability, preventing verifiers from correlating multiple uses of the same credential.

- **Decentralization**: 
  - Distribute the signing process across multiple nodes, leveraging blockchain technology. Use Ethereum smart contracts for credential issuance and verification.

- **Anonymity**: 
  - Implement strong blind signatures to prevent tracking of user activities, further enhancing privacy.

## Implementation Tools

- **Solidity**: For writing smart contracts that manage credential issuance and verification.
- **Python**: For scripting and automating various components of the protocol.
- **Ganache**: To create a local Ethereum blockchain for testing and development.
- **Truffle**: For managing the development, testing, and deployment of smart contracts.

## Simulation Environment
Utilize Ganache and Truffle to thoroughly test and debug the application before deploying on the mainnet.

## Innovative Aspects
This project represents the first implementation of a Threshold BBS+ based anonymous credential scheme in a blockchain environment, setting a new standard for privacy and security in decentralized applications.

## Potential Applications
- Secure and anonymous voting systems.
- Privacy-preserving identity verification.
- Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications requiring high levels of privacy.

## Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Set up the local Ethereum environment using Ganache.
4. Deploy the smart contracts with Truffle.
5. Run the Python scripts for testing and automation.
